## Project Overview: Stage 1

This project required converting a static web page of an in progress restaurant reviews application. The code's styling was made responsive for different displays using media queries. Accessibility features were also added for users using screen reader technologies.

A service worker was also added to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.


### What do I do from here?

In the project folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.


## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
